# Research

## Current Projects

### Assisted Path Planning in an Impeded Environment
Developing multi-agent path planning algorithms for complex applications such as warehouse operations and emergency vehicle escorts. Our approach includes:
- Asynchronous motion planning for primary and assisting agents
- Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based anytime algorithm for efficient solution finding
- Rerouting algorithms combining k-shortest path planning and D*Lite for stochastic environments

### Object Detection and Tracking for Autonomous Vehicles
Creating a real-time tracking system for autonomous vehicles, focusing on challenging weather conditions:
- Modified Multiple Hypothesis Tracking (MHT) and YOLOv3 for object detection
- Sensor fusion algorithm combining radar and thermal camera data for a robust 180Â° field of view

## Past Projects

### Electric Racing Vehicle Design
Led a team in designing an award-winning electric racing vehicle for the Formula Student competition:
- Managed electric powertrain development and customized battery pack design
- Implemented CAN-bus communication for sensor integration
- Designed a PID controller for torque vectoring
