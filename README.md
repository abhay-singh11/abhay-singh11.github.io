## Work Experience
**Research Intern @ Los Alamos National Laboratory (_Jan 2024 - Present_)**
- Formulated a novel Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP) with fairness constraints as a Mixed-Integer Second Order Cone program, a computationally efficient alternative to state-of-the-art min-max MTSP; developed a custom branch-and-cut algorithm to solve it optimally.
- Proposed a framework for the trade-off analysis between efficiency vs safety in an autonomous platoon under emergency braking maneuvers with uncertain breaking capacity; Developed Temporal Normalizing Flow Neural Network to estimate the collision probability.

**Chief Electronics Officer @ IIT Bombay Racing (_April 2014 - May 2017_)**
- Led a 70-member team to designing an award winning electric racing vehicle for the Formula Student competition in Silverstone, UK.
- Managed electric powertrain development, including a customized battery pack; Developed CAN-bus communication for sensor integration.
- Designed a PID controller for torque vectoring in the vehicle by using the feedback from the various sensors and the motor controller.


## Projects
### Assisted Path Planning in an Impeded Environment
- Developed a Multi-Agent Path Planning algorithm with asynchronous motion for complex applications, such as warehouse operation or an emergency vehicle escort, where an assisting agent can help the primary agent to complete a given task in a deterministic environment; Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based anytime algorithm is also developed to find good feasible solution with limited computation time.
- For the stochastic environment, we developed an efficient rerouting algorithm for the primary agent by combining the k-shortest path planning algorithm and D*Lite algorithm; also solved a Rural Postman Problem with Time Window constraints for the assisting agent path.

### Object Detection and Tracking for Autonomous Vehicles
- Develop a novel real-time tracking system for autonomous vehicles using Modified Multiple Hypothesis Tracking (MHT) and YOLOv3 for object detection during challenging weather conditions (night-time, direct sun glare, fog) improving over baseline model by 52%.
- Developed a sensor fusion algorithm to combining the data from radar and 5 thermal cameras to achieve a robust 180o field of view.
